# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 14, 2026**

## Overview

DailyWisdom is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe that an app for personal reflection should respect your personal space.

## Data Collection

**DailyWisdom does not collect any data.**

Specifically, we do not collect:
- Personal information
- Usage analytics
- Crash reports
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- Any form of telemetry

## Data Storage

All data created by DailyWisdom is stored locally on your device:

- **Favorite quotes** – Stored in a local SwiftData database
- **Quote view history** – Stored locally to improve quote selection variety
- **Preferences** – Stored in UserDefaults on your device

This data never leaves your Mac.

## Network Activity

DailyWisdom makes **zero network requests**. The app:
- Works entirely offline
- Does not connect to any servers
- Does not download or upload any data
- Does not check for updates (handled by the Mac App Store)

## Third-Party Services

DailyWisdom does not integrate with any third-party services, SDKs, or analytics platforms.

## Screen Lock Detection

DailyWisdom uses macOS system notifications to detect when you unlock your screen. This is done using Apple's public `DistributedNotificationCenter` API. The app:
- Only receives a notification that the screen was unlocked
- Does not access any information about your lock screen
- Does not access your password or biometric data
- Cannot see what apps were open before locking

## Permissions

DailyWisdom requests no special permissions beyond standard app sandbox access. The app does not request access to:
- Contacts
- Calendar
- Photos
- Camera
- Microphone
- Location
- Files outside its sandbox

## Children's Privacy

DailyWisdom does not collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change our privacy practices, we will update this policy and the "Last Updated" date above. Given our commitment to collecting no data, significant changes are unlikely.
